The femurs can be raised and lowered respectively and unilateral shortening of the leg and the resulting pelvic inclination can be simulated. How this is compensated in the pelvis and vertebral column can be shown in the model. Mounting of the rib cage (thorax) with the shoulder girdle allows explanation of the combination of movements of the vertebral column and thoracic cage during breathing and respiratory gymnastics. </div>\r\n\t<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\t<div>Easily removed from stand.</div>\r\n\t<div><br />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t<div>Size: 78 cm, weight: 5.4 kg&nbsp;</div><br />\r\n\t</div>     "}
