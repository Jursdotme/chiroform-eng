{"id":"1687","sku":"057-C004","name":"Chiroform CAT EX Adjuster","descr":"The CAT EX is designed for the requirements of Sacro Occipital Technique (SOT) adjusting and clinicians who require greater thrust than traditional adjusting tools. Adjustable from 20-62 AFR*. The CAT EX includes the CAT palm and finger pads .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe CAT EX - Chiropractic Adjusting Tool is the most affordable thrust adjustment device available. The CAT is designed for greater reliability and durability. The CATÂ´s precision components provide smooth and easy operation. Force devices deliver targeted force to the joint as opposed to manual adjustments that also activate the surrounding muscle; this means less resistance occurs and less force is needed to make the necessary adjustment. Handheld adjusting tools can alleviate some of the physical stress on a clinician, allowing for easier adjustments. The CAT was ergonomically designed and the CAT can be easily operated by any clinician regardless of hand size.The CAT is compatible with the established protocols your clinicians are currently using. The CAT is designed with an Average Force Range (AFR) of 45-60 (pounds-force), the high range can be used for larger joints and the lower range for smaller or more delicate joints. The CAT also has an available cervical tip accessory that reduces the velocity of the device without reducing force. With our optional CAT accessories you can customize your CAT to your comfort and the needs of your clients.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe CAT EX comes standard with a 12-month warranty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCAT EX Specifications<br />\r\nWeight: 0.54 pounds<br />\r\nLength: 6\"<br />\r\nWidth: 2.9\"<br />\r\nDepth: 0.92\"<br />\r\nThrust Range: 20-62 AFR     "}
