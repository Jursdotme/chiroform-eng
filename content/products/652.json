{"id":"652","sku":"493-C128","name":"Trigger Point Pressure Device","descr":"\r\n<p>The Wooden T-Bar is a new deep tissue massage tool ergonomically designed to protect practitioners from occupational injuries. It allows more focused, deeper work with less physical efforts.</p>\r\n<p>With the T-Bar, the thumbs are no longer used to release trigger points, they can relax. The contoured hand grip encourages neutral wrist positions while working. This puts an end to wrist hyperextension and the painful problems it creates, so the wrists can relax too. The thera press implements a safe way of working by transferring the work load away from the muscles, unto the skeletal system. By avoiding direct use of the thumb, uneven, repetitive stress to muscles and joint capsules of both the hand and arm are eliminated.</p>\r\n<p>Specifications :</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1. Made of Natural Wood.<br />\r\n\t2. Perfect for deep trigger point massage.<br />\r\n\t3. Easy to handle and carry.<br />\r\n\t4. Color available: Natural.</p>     "}
