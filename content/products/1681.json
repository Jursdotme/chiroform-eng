{"id":"1681","sku":"C007","name":"Chiroform CAT Pediatric Instrument","descr":"The Chiroform CAT Pediatric Insrument maintains the same quality standard as the Chiroform CAT Instrumentl. It is built with the same ergonomic design, but offers clinicians a lower force range, 10 to 23 AFR (Average Force Range measured in pounds-force), for more sensitive adjustments. The Chiroform CAT Pediatric comes with a tip which tapers gently down to 0.5cm2. The tips were designed to allow clinicians to easily make adjustments in small joints that are potentially difficult to locate and manipulate. The Chiroform CAT Pediatric is a great tool for delicate adjustments for geriatric patients. The device has 15 referenced force settings allowing clinicians to record the settings used in treatment. The device also stands out with its appealing blue coloring making it easy for clinicians to differentiate between their adjusting tools. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chiroform CAT Pediatric Instrument comes standard with a 12 month warranty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  "}
