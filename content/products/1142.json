If the vertebrae are pressed, a prolapse can be pressed out of the disc. The prolapse can be formed by compression and also by torsion as well as by combination of these movements. The model represents two lumbar vertebrae in about twice life size. </P>\r\n<P>This simulator is protected by international patents. </P>\r\n<P>The bulb would have to be excanged durint time.
