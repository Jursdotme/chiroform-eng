{"id":"869","sku":"CTX","name":"Kinesiotape 5M Rolls","descr":"\r\n<p>The Kinesio Tape method involves taping over and around muscles in order to assist and give support or to prevent over-contraction. The first technique gives the practitioner the opportunity to actually give support while maintaining full range of motion. This enables the individual to participate in their normal physical activity with functional assistance. The second technique, which is most commonly used in the acute stage of rehabilitation, helps prevent overuse or over-contraction and helps provide facilitation of lymph flow for an entire 24 hour period. Correctional techniques include mechanical, lymphatic, ligament/tendon, fascia, space and functional. Kinesio Tape can be used in conjunction with other therapies, including cryotherapy, hydrotherapy, massage therapy, and electrical stimulation.</p>\r\n<p>Kinesio Tape affects the activation of the neurological system, the body´s information processor and the circulatory system. Muscles are not only attributed to the movements of the body, but they also control the circulation of venous and lymph flows, body temperature, etc. Therefore, the failure of the muscles to function properly induces various kinds of symptoms. Consequently, more attention was given to the importance of muscle function, that the idea of treating the muscles in order to activate the body´s own healing process came about. Using an elastic tape, such as Kinesio Tape, it was discovered that muscles and other tissues could be helped by outside assistance. <br />\r\n\t</p>        "}
