The red light (660 nm) stimulates the micro circulation in the surface of the skin, and the blue/violet light (405 nm) helps reduce bacteria in the surface of the skin. The result is a very powerful treatment that stimulates the body’s functions in several areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe advantages of treatment with the GigaLaser include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*&nbsp; Larger effect and hence faster healing<br />\r\n*&nbsp; Improves the body’s ability to heal itself faster<br />\r\n*&nbsp; Quick and efficient pain relief in large areas of the body<br />\r\n*&nbsp; Practitioner is not required to be present during the entire treatment – or other treatment can be given at the same time, e.g. acupuncture<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe GigaLaser delivers a very large dosage of laser light in a very short amount of time, and treatment with the GigaLaser is therefore less time consuming and, at the same time, more efficient for both the patient and the practitioner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA simple and user-friendly touch screen with six pre-defined treatment programs makes it easy for the practitioner to use the laser.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe GigaLaser comes with a 2-year warranty against material and manufacturing defects.<br />\r\n  "}
