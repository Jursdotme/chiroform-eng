The \r\nfirst technique gives the practitioner the opportunity to actually give \r\nsupport while maintaining full range of motion. This enables the \r\nindividual to participate in their normal physical activity with \r\nfunctional assistance. The second technique, which is most commonly used\r\n in the acute stage of rehabilitation, helps prevent overuse or \r\nover-contraction and helps provide facilitation of lymph flow for an \r\nentire 24 hour period. Correctional techniques include mechanical, \r\nlymphatic, ligament/tendon, fascia, space and functional. Kinesio Tape \r\ncan be used in conjunction with other therapies, including cryotherapy, \r\nhydrotherapy, massage therapy, and electrical stimulation.</p>Kinesio Tape affects the activation of the neurological system, the \r\nbody´s information processor and the circulatory system. Muscles are not\r\n only attributed to the movements of the body, but they also control the\r\n circulation of venous and lymph flows, body temperature, etc. \r\nTherefore, the failure of the muscles to function properly induces \r\nvarious kinds of symptoms. Consequently, more attention was given to the\r\n importance of muscle function, that the idea of treating the muscles in\r\n order to activate the body´s own healing process came about. Using an \r\nelastic tape, such as Kinesio Tape, it was discovered that muscles and \r\nother tissues could be helped by outside assistance.    "}
