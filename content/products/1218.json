{"id":"1218","sku":"460-NV500","name":"Neck Vitalizer w/Biofeedback Monitor","descr":"\r\n<p>Due to the prevalence of working and gaming at computers, a large portion of the population have developed or are developing Forward Head Posture and Closed Chest Syndrome™ by constantly leaning their heads towards computers and reaching their hands and arms forward. Such development leads to increased stress and pain in neck and shoulder muscles, as well as to the occurrence or exaggeration of Thoracic Outlet Syndrome and related numbness, tingling and pain in arms and hands.</p>\r\n<p>Neck Vitalizer M5™ is clinically designed to help users reverse Forward Head Posture, reduce the stress and tension in the neck and shoulder muscles, relieve neck pain and shoulder pain, restore the healthy and natural neuromuscular pattern for upright head, neck and chest posture, and relieve Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, all by just resting on it for 20 minutes, twice a day.</p>\r\n<p>A person with Forward Head Posture carries the head significantly forward of the shoulders or of the gravitational center line of the upper body, as viewed from the side, even when not working at a computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\r\n<p>With each inch of forward protrusion of the head, the tension and stress on the related neck and shoulder muscles increases by 100%. With a common 2-3 inches of forward protrusion of the head, the stress and tension on the associated neck and shoulder muscles quickly triples and quadruples, as if the person was carrying 3 or more additional heads (10 lb each) on the shoulders everywhere they go. Overtime, Forward Head Posture weakens the associated neck and shoulder muscles and leads to persistent neck pain and/or shoulder pain, even recurring headaches. </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t</p>   "}
