Just as importantly, it is not so thight that it is restrictive. Excess or insufficient motion can adversely effect the entire musculoskeletal system. The Chiroform Sacroiliac Belt, by providing the correct balance of resistance and resilience, re-establishs the joint`s normal motion. Because of the&nbsp;stability the Chiroform Sacroilliac Belt gives to the base of your spine, strength is increased throughout your back, hips, and legs, and your chances of injury are lessened considerably during work or play. A column of stacked blocks is only as stable as its base. With instability, the column weakens.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>         "}
